# Day #05 – Digital Piano 🎹

## Project Overview
A small **Digital Piano** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that plays musical notes when the user clicks on piano keys or presses mapped keyboard keys.

This project demonstrates the use of the **Web Audio API** (AudioContext, OscillatorNode, GainNode), keyboard and mouse events, simple ADSR-style envelopes, and a responsive user interface.  
No external audio files are used — all sounds are synthesized directly in the browser.
